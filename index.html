            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated computer engineering honors student at Texas A&M University, currently in my junior year. My passion for technology and its potential to improve our lives has driven me to make the most of my academic and extracurricular opportunities. </p>

            <p>I have conducted research in the field of parallel computations in particle physics, which has broadened my knowledge and inspired me to pursue further advancement in the field. I have also served as a peer teacher for several courses, including Data and Algorithms, Computer Organization, and Introduction to Computer Programming. This experience has allowed me to share my passion for technology and help others understand complex concepts. </p>
                
            <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively seek to expand my horizons and grow as an individual by participating in service and leadership organizations on campus. These experiences have taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and leadership and have given me the opportunity to make a positive impact on my community. </p>
                
            <p>My core values of motivation, diligence, and persistence drive me to achieve my goals and make the most of every opportunity. I am confident that my passion and dedication to computer engineering will allow me to make a meaningful contribution to the field and beyond. </p>
                
            <p>With my expected graduation date of May 2024, I am eager to see where my education and experiences will take me in the future. I am determined to make the most of my time at Texas A&M and to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the world.</p>
