                            for my mentee. With a group, we will go out to the ranch once a week for the mentorship

                            play sports and learn about God. This is a healthy escape for most of the kids involved from there

                            my freshman year, I was a camp counsoler for TBarM. There I would spread the word to
                            younger generations of Christians, and also facilitate fun. I also met other great people
                            there, who were passionate about living life to the fullest.</p>
