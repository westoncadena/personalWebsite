                        <h4>Mentorship Program</h4>
                        <p>Still Creek Ranch is a boys and girls club near the Bryan area that saves
                            children from crisis situations. At Still Creek Ranch, I serve as a mentor for 
                            a boy on the ranch. As I mentor I am a positive male rolemodel as well as a friend
                            for my mentee. With a group, we will go out to the ranch once a week for the mentorship
                            program.

                        <p>TBarM is a Christian sports summer camp located in New Braunfels, Texas. The summer of
                            my freshman year, I was a camp counsoler for TBarM. There I would spread the word to
                            younger generations of Christians, and also facilitate fun. I also met other great people
                            there, who were passionate about living life to the fullest.

                        <p>Refuge is a youth ministry program that Restoration Church Bryan puts on every Thursday. There,
                            we will pick up the kids from around the neighborhood, and bring them to the church where we will
                            play sports and learn about God. This is a healthy escape for most of the kids involved from there
                            every day life.
